PowerGridSynth Documentation
============================

PowerGridSynth (Power grid synthesizer) is an open source project written in Python, dedicated to build **synthetic power grids**. The goal of the project is to provide realistic yet synthetic power grids for grid modeling, simulation and analysis, with the ultimate goal of building **Foundation Models** for power grids. It is part of `LF Energy <https://lfenergy.org>`_, a Linux Foundation focused on energy sector. This project is supported by `AI-EFFECT (Artificial Intelligence Experimentation Facility For the Energy Sector) <https://ai-effect.eu/>`_.

It contains three main parts:

- grid topology generation,
- grid data generation,
- grid data utility.
